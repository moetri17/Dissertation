# Dissertation

## Introduction
Welcome to the GitHub repository for my final year dissertation project, which involved the creation of a mobile application to assist the Muslim community at Northumbria University. This application encompasses various features catering to the needs of the Muslim students and faculty, ranging from prayer times for Newcastle Upon Tyne, access to the Quran, information about events hosted by the Northumbria University Islamic Society (ISOC), to locating mosques for international or unfamiliar students, and providing remembrance phrases (Athkar). Additionally, the application includes a chatbot implemented using the OpenAI API, aimed at providing support to the Muslim community at Northumbria University.

3. **Dependency Installation:**
   - Download all dependencies using `npx expo install` and `npm install`.
4. **Development Server Start:**
   - Start the development server on your chosen IDE (VS Code was used for this project).
5. **Repository Cloning:**
   - Clone the GitHub repository and run the development server in the cloned directory.
6. **Loading the Application:**
   - Follow the steps to load the application on your mobile device or emulator (This will require Android Studio setup).

## Setup (Laravel)
1. **Laravel Configuration:**
   - Visit the official Laravel website and configure Laravel.
